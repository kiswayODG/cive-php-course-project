# README - PHP Project

## Introduction

This PHP project is a dynamic web application developed using the XAMPP server. The application caters to various functionalities and employs a robust architecture for scalability and maintainability.

## Uncontrolled Behaviors

Certain behaviors might not be fully controllable when using servers other than XAMPP. It is highly recommended to use XAMPP for optimal deployment and behavior consistency.

## Technologies Used

### Front-End

- **Bootstrap:** Utilized extensively for creating a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
- **jQuery:** Employed for dynamic page interactions and enhanced user experience.
- **CKEditor:** Integrated for a WYSIWYG text editing experience.
- **AltoRouter:** Utilized for efficient routing within the application.

### Back-End

- **PHP:** The primary server-side scripting language driving the application.
- **XAMPP:** Chosen as the development server for its ease of use and comprehensive features.

## Architecture

The application adheres to a layered architecture to ensure a clean and organized codebase:

1. **Model Layer (Model):** Contains classes representing business entities and their behaviors.
2. **Repository Layer:** Manages data access and communication with the underlying database.
3. **Service Layer (Controller):** Handles business logic and acts as an intermediary between the Model and Repository layers.
4. **View Layer:** Comprises PHP files responsible for rendering the user interface dynamically.

## Dynamic Views

All views in the application are dynamic, offering an interactive and responsive user experience. Notably, the gallery view is designed to be static, providing a straightforward display.

## Absolute Paths

Paths within the application are defined as absolute, taking the project directory as the root. It is crucial to adjust paths accordingly during deployment to ensure proper resource linking.

## Deployment

For a successful deployment, follow these comprehensive steps:

1. Install XAMPP on the deployment server to ensure compatibility.
2. Copy all project files to the server, maintaining directory structures.
3. Configure database settings in the dedicated configuration file.
4. Import the provided database located in the `database` folder.
5. Verify and set correct file permissions for security considerations.
6. Access the application via a web browser using the appropriate URL.

Regularly check for project updates and adhere to security best practices during deployment to safeguard the application.

## Additional Notes

- **Development Environment:** The project has been primarily developed and tested using the XAMPP server. Deviations in behavior might occur with alternative server configurations.
- **External Libraries:** The project utilizes Bootstrap, jQuery, CKEditor, and AltoRouter for enhanced functionality. Refer to their respective documentation for further customization.
